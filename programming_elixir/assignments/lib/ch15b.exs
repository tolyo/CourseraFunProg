  Use spawn_link to start a process, and have that process send a message
  to the parent and then exit immediately. Meanwhile, sleep for 500 ms in
  the parent, then receive as many messages as are waiting. Trace what
  you receive. Does it matter that you werenâ€™t waiting for the notification
  from the child when it exited?
  Answer: NO IT DOES NOT. Changing to spawn_monitor prevents from crashing
